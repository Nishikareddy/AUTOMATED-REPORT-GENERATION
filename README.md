DESCRIPTION:This project is a Python-based application that automatically generates a student score report in PDF format using data from a CSV file. The project makes use of two popular Python libraries—pandas for data handling and analysis, and fpdf for creating the PDF report. The CSV file, named data.csv, contains student information such as names, subjects, and scores. The program starts by reading this data and then performs basic analysis to find the average score of all students, the highest and lowest scores, and identifies the topper (the student who scored the highest marks). These details help give a quick overview of the overall class performance. After calculating these values, the program creates a neatly formatted PDF report. The report includes a title at the top called “Student Score Report,” followed by the summary section that displays the average score, highest score, lowest score, and the name of the topper. Below this, a detailed table is added that lists each student along with the subject and their score, giving a complete view of all entries in the data file. The table is organized and easy to read, making the report look professional. Finally, the generated report is saved as sample_report.pdf, and a message is displayed to confirm that the PDF has been successfully created. This project is especially useful for teachers, school administrators, or anyone who needs to create performance reports regularly. Instead of creating reports manually, this script allows the user to generate them quickly and accurately with just one click. It can save a lot of time and reduce the chances of human error. The project can also be easily customized—for example, by changing the layout, adding more statistics like grade levels or pass/fail status, or even adding charts for visual representation. Overall, this is a simple yet practical project that combines data analysis with report generation, making it a valuable tool in educational or administrative environments.
